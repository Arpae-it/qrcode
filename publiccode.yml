    longDescription: |
      Probably one of the shortest pieces of code to easily produce qr codes online.
      Based on the qrcode R package ("https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qrcode/index.html") and written in less than 50 lines of code, it's an example of a deployable tool to allow collegues to generate and edit qr codes online. 
      Sample text or hyperlinks can be included in the generated qr codes. The user is free to edit the colors and masks of the generated qr code.
      A working example is here
